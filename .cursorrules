You are an expert in Node.js, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional programming patterns; avoid classes except for custom error types.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isConnected, hasError).
- Structure files: exported functions, middleware, helpers, static content, types.
- Organize code into layers: controllers, services, repositories, models, and utilities.
- Keep controllers thin; move business logic to services.
- Separate route definitions from controller logic.
- Limit files to a single responsibility; avoid large files with multiple classes or functions.

Naming Conventions:
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., routes/auth-routes).
- Use PascalCase for interfaces and types (e.g., UserDocument).
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and method names.

TypeScript Usage:
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Use explicit types for function parameters and return types.
- Utilize generics to create reusable components and functions.
- Use type annotations for function parameters and return types.
- Use TypeScript enums for fixed sets of constants when appropriate.

Express and Middleware:
- Use Express Router for organizing routes.
- Use middleware functions for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., authentication, logging, error handling).
- Order middleware properly in Express to ensure correct request handling.
- Keep middleware functions focused and reusable.
- Use async/await with try-catch blocks for error handling in route handlers.

MongoDB and Mongoose:
- Define Mongoose schemas using TypeScript interfaces.
- Use Mongoose middleware (pre/post hooks) sparingly and with caution.
- Prefer Mongoose queries over the MongoDB native driver when possible.
- Use lean() for read-only operations to improve performance.

Syntax and Formatting:
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and anonymous functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use template literals for string interpolation.

Error Handling:
- Use custom error classes extending Error for specific error types.
- Use a centralized error handling middleware.
- Implement proper error logging and monitoring.

API Design:
- Follow RESTful principles for API endpoints.
- Use versioning in API routes (e.g., /api/v1/users).
- Use Joi for proper input validation.

Performance Optimization:
- Use connection pooling for MongoDB connections.
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate (e.g., Redis).
- Use indexing in MongoDB to optimize query performance.
- Implement pagination for large data sets.

Authentication and Security:
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling.
- Use CORS middleware to handle cross-origin requests.
- Always sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

Testing:
- Write unit tests for utility functions and helpers.
- Use integration tests for testing API endpoints.
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- Use mocking for external services and databases in tests.

Documentation:
- Maintain a comprehensive README.md with setup and API documentation.
- Use Swagger or similar tools for API documentation.

Environment and Configuration:
- Use dotenv for managing environment variables.
- Implement a configuration module to centralize app settings.
- Use different configuration profiles for development, testing, and production.
- Use pnpm as your package manager.

Logging:
- Implement structured logging using a library like Winston.
- Use log levels appropriately (error, warn, info, debug).
- Avoid logging sensitive information.

Code Quality:
- Use ESLint with appropriate rules for TypeScript and Node.js.
- Implement pre-commit hooks to run linters and formatters.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Dependency Management:
- Keep dependencies up-to-date, but be cautious with major version upgrades.
- Use exact versions in package.json to ensure reproducible builds.
- Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
